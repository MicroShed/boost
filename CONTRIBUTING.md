The boost repository requires DCO signing.
By adding a signed off line to your commit, you verify the following, [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org).

You can add the signed off line to your commit by adding the -s flag to the git commit command.

If you'd like to automatically sign off all of your commits you can add a prepare-commit-msg hook to do so. A good example can be found in the [Git prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/wiki/DCO-signing) repository DCO wiki entry at the bottom of the page.

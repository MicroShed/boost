#  - This requires that a current level of Eclipse is defined on your machine 

# This hook will run the eclipse code formatter before any commit.
# This will format Java code files that are part of the commit.
# The java code will be formatted based on the preferences defined
# in the java.prefs file provided in the base directory of this project.
#
# Note: this script requires a linux environment to run (linux/MacOSX/cygwin)
# this will not execute in a native Windows environment.
#
# Update the following items below then save this file in

# be sure you have execute authority for this file. 

# set this to the location of your Eclipse installation
# Example: /Users/mac/EclipseInstalls/EclipseO2/EClipse.app/Contents/MacOS
